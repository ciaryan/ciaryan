## 💁🏻‍♂️ About me

- 🎓 Hi, I’m Ciarán (keer-AWN), a Data Scientist based in London working in ML model design and Generative AI prompt flows and workflows. I have a Masters degree in Statistics (1:1) from University College Dublin, and a BSc in Medicinal Chemistry (1:1) also from UCD. 
- 🚀 I’m currently working on using Generative AI models to automate laborious processes for clients, but keeping to my ML and Statistics roots! Not all problems can be solved with AI, and I am enjoying finding out where those limitations are.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Prompt Flows using Azure ML Studio, revising my Deep Learning methods using TensorFlow, and always love hearing new ideas for presentations of findings to non-technical audiences.
